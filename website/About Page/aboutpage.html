<title>ABOUT ME!</title>
<body> 
<h1>EVERYTHING ABOUT MEEEE!!!!</h1>
<p>I am 13 years old and I live in Taipei! My hobbies include playing Minecraft, drawing, and reading! I am just starting to be able to code websites
so if there are weird words or tabs coming out it is probably because I am trying to add something to the website. </p>

<h1>SOMETHING I AM VERY OBSESSED WITH...</h1>
<p>I am super obsessed with dance moms. I watch it every week no matter what! My favorite girl in the show is Chloe. I am so sad that she left! 
I would be more than happy to talk to anyone about dance moms in the comments section! Another thing that I am obsessed with is Center 
Stage: En Pointe! I didn't have time to watch the first episode because I had an important event to attend, but I watch the videos from 
Youtube and Chloe's social media.</p> 
<h1>Okay...before this gets too boring, I'm going to put a gif here :::))))</h1>

<p>I know some people might not agree with me, but I am NOT a really big fan of Star Wars... I just found this gif on the internet and 
thought it was really cute. The same goes with the avacado gif in te start page. I am not a fan of avacado. </p>
<h1>Wait another thing (for totoro lovers)</h1>
<p>Doesn't this picture make you think of the mini totoro that is white?</p>
